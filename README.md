# World of Warcraft Keys
## My Universal Tank Keybind System

This setup treats tanking as a role-based system, not six separate class kits.

Instead of learning a new rotation for every tank, each key is assigned a single, universal job: primary mitigation, secondary mitigation, core builder, AoE spender, offensive cooldown, major defensive, utility, and movement. Every tank spec maps its equivalent ability to the same key.

The result is that switching tanks doesn’t require relearning muscle memory. Your hands already know what to press — you only need to learn when to press it for each class. Warrior becomes the baseline mental model, and other tanks inherit that logic.

Some specs (Warrior, Guardian) align naturally with this structure and feel rhythmic and predictable. Others (Blood DK, Brewmaster, Vengeance) are more reactive, but the system still works by anchoring decisions to the same inputs: “press Q to mitigate,” “press F to enter an offensive window,” “press Z when you need a real defensive.”

This approach reduces cognitive load, improves consistency across characters, and turns tanking into a transferable skill rather than a spec-specific memorization exercise.

At its best, it doesn’t make every tank play the same — it makes every tank think the same.
